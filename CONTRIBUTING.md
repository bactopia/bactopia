Contributions to Bactopia are welcome!

While there is not a formal *contribution protocol*, using 
[GitHub Flow style development](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) should be just fine.

Please submit any pull requests against the master branch, and (*hopefully in a timely manner*) your  
changes will be reviewed for merging.
